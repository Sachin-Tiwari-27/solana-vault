# 🧠 Solana Vault

A secure and lightweight smart contract built on the Solana blockchain using the Anchor framework. This vault allows users to store and retrieve encrypted notes tied to their wallets.

## 🔍 Purpose

This project is part of my learning journey into Solana smart contract development using Rust and Anchor. The idea is to build secure and auditable on-chain programs while exploring key concepts like:

- Program Derived Addresses (PDA)
- Seeds and Bumps
- Context structs and Account validation
- Error handling with custom error types
- TypeScript-based integration testing
